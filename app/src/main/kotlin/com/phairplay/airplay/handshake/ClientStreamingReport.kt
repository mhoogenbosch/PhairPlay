/**
 * ClientStreamingReport — the sender's own view of the mirroring stream, sent once per second
 * as mirror payload type 5 (see [MirrorStreamServer]).
 *
 * WHY: this is the only feedback the sender volunteers, and the receiver used to discard it
 * unread. It answers the question our own counters cannot: when the picture is bad, is the
 * sender failing to produce frames, is the network dropping them, or is our decoder behind?
 * [encoderFps] versus our own decode rate separates the first case from the third, and
 * [lossAvg] with [txUsageAvg]/[txCapacityAvg] separates out the second.
 *
 * The payload is a binary plist. When the sending device's screen is locked, a fixed
 * 25,000-byte trailer of unidentified content follows it — the plist must be parsed from the
 * leading bytes only, or the parse fails and the report is lost precisely when the situation
 * is unusual.
 *
 * Ported from Matej-Hajek/PhairPlayPhone (Apache-2.0, commit ed02ab8).
 *
 * Field names are Apple's and undocumented. The set below was read off a live iOS session
 * from a live iOS session; [entries] keeps the raw map so a sender that
 * reports something new does not lose it.
