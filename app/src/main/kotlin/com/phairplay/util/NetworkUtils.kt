/**
 * NetworkUtils — Helper functions for reading network interface information.
 *
 * WHY: The AirPlay protocol requires the receiver to advertise its MAC address
 * and device name via mDNS TXT records. This class provides clean, safe methods
 * to read this information from the Android system.
 *
 * HOW: All methods are static (on the companion object) — no instance needed.
 * Read the device name and MAC address once at startup and pass them to MdnsService.
 *
 * Example:
 *   val name = NetworkUtils.getDeviceName(context)   // "My Android TV"
 *   val mac  = NetworkUtils.getMacAddress(context)    // "aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff" (stable, unique per install)
 *   val uuid = NetworkUtils.getPersistentUuid(context) // stable UUID per device
 */

     * This is the name that will appear in the macOS AirPlay picker, so it's
     * important that it matches what the user set in their TV's settings.
     *
     * Sources tried in order:
     * 1. Settings.Global.DEVICE_NAME (Android 5+, most TVs)
     * 2. Settings.Secure.BLUETOOTH_NAME (Bluetooth device name, often same as device name)
     * 3. Fallback: "PhairPlay" (if neither source is available)
     *
     * SECURITY: The returned value is sanitized — mDNS service names must not contain
     * certain special characters. We strip any character outside [A-Za-z0-9 _-].
     *
     * @param context Android context (needed to read system settings)

     * Returns the device's Wi-Fi or Ethernet MAC address.

     * The MAC address is used as the `deviceid` in AirPlay mDNS TXT records.
     * It uniquely identifies this receiver to macOS senders.
     *
     * Tries Wi-Fi first (most TVs are Wi-Fi), then falls back to any available
     * non-loopback interface, then uses a fake address as last resort.
     *
     * NOTE: On Android 10+, direct MAC access is restricted. We use NetworkInterface
     * instead of WifiManager.getConnectionInfo() which is deprecated.
     *
     * CRITICAL for a fleet: `deviceid` is the identity iOS keys an AirPlay receiver on. Modern
     * Android withholds the real hardware MAC (returns null or the constant 02:00:00:00:00:00), so
     * every install used to fall back to the SAME hardcoded aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff — meaning all TVs on
     * the LAN advertised one identity and iOS merged them / showed one name for all. When no unique
     * hardware MAC is available we now derive a stable, locally-administered, unicast MAC from the
     * per-install persistent UUID, so each device gets a distinct but stable deviceid.
     *
